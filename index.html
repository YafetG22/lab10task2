    <h1>Lab 10 – Framework Web Page</h1>

    <p>
        This web page is built and hosted using <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, a static hosting framework that allows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects to be published directly from a GitHub repository. 
        For Problem 2, I was required to use a web development framework, explain how I installed or set it up, describe how I built this page, and discuss any difficulties I encountered along the way.
    </p>

    <h2>Framework Used: GitHub Pages</h2>
    <p>
        GitHub Pages is a hosting framework provided by GitHub. It automatically deploys a website from a repository, which makes it easy to use for beginners and does not require a backend server.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Installed or Set Up the Framework</h2>
    <p>
        1. I created a new public GitHub repository named <em>lab10-framework</em>.<br>
        2. I added an <code>index.html</code> file to the repository with HTML and CSS content.<br>
        3. In the repository settings, I scrolled to the “Pages” section.<br>
        4. Under Source, I selected <strong>Deploy from a branch</strong> and chose the <strong>main branch /root</strong>.<br>
        5. GitHub Pages automatically built and published the live website.
    </p>

    <h2>How I Built the Page</h2>
    <p>
        I wrote a simple HTML and CSS layout that includes a title section, paragraph text, headings, and styling. 
        The page explains what GitHub Pages is, how I used it, and how I completed the assignment requirements. 
        All code was written manually without using prohibited frameworks such as Bootstrap or jQuery.
    </p>

    <h2>Difficulties Encountered & How I Solved Them</h2>
    <p>
        - At first, GitHub Pages did not load because I forgot to name the main file <code>index.html</code>.<br>
        - I also had to enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings before the site appeared online.<br>
        - There was a short delay before the live site updated, so I learned that each change must be committed and then republished automatically by GitHub Pages.
        <br><br>
        After fixing the file name and selecting the correct deployment branch, everything worked correctly.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Website URL</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>https://ygebrese.github.io/lab10-framework</strong>  
        <br>(Replace with your actual GitHub Pages URL if different)
